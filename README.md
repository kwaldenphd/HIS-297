# Reading list and schedule for HIS 297 Fall 2019 Grinnell College course on oral history and digital history

# Course Description

Students in this independent study will study the theory and method of oral history, particularly as it pertains to minoritized populations in the United States.  They will then put this knowledge to use as they work to conduct oral histories during the Grinnell Multicultural Alumni Reunion in November.  Students will also analyze digital technologies and platforms relevant to oral history collection, organization, and dissemination. Students will acquire hands-on skills in audio recording and editing, object scanning, metadata, project management, and digital exhibit design. Students hired to this position will actively participate in the Multicultural Alumni Reunion (November 8-10, 2019) through work that will include recording alumni oral histories, doing archival research, and helping curate pop-up exhibits.

Students will meet weekly in a small group with 1-3 instructors to discuss readings, learn technologies, and engage in project management on the oral history aspect of the alumni reunion project.   They will submit a draft of a co-authored manual for Grinnell multicultural alumni oral histories on October 17, 2019 and a final version of the manual on December 12, 2019.
